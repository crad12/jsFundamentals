// Comparison Operators

3 = 3 // This does not compare these numbers

// Equal
'3' == 3

// Not Equal
'3' != 4

// Strict Equal (Only on Strict does it check data types)
3 === 3

// Strict Not Equal (Only on Strict does it check data types)
'3' !== 3  // '3' is a string, therefore it does not equal 3

// Greater Than
4 > 3

// Less Than
3 > 4

// Less than or Equal to
3 <= 3

// Greater than or Equal to
4 >= 3 // Not => because that is called a "Fat Arrow"

// And
2 === 2 && 3 !== 4

// Or
'2' === 2 || 3 !== 4
